    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After month of waiting<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I have finally received package from GitHub Shop with
a bunch of Octocat stickers. Stuck one on my notebook, one on my front door and
gave a few to a friends. Pretty cute little things. Definitely, Github has gained
so much popularity thanks to mascot.</p>

<p>Now for the code. As you may know, recently <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust 0.9 had released</a>.
Today I was updating code in my small
<a href="https://github.com/JIghtuse/rosetta">rosetta</a> repo (solutions for
<a href="http://rosettacode.org/">rosettacode</a>) and discover one funny easter egg.</p>

<p>Here is a program for finding the limit of recursion in Rust 0.9 (version for
Rust 0.8 differs only by printing line).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">recurse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;deep: {:d}&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">recurse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fn</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">recurse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code has failing with segfault in Rust 0.8 printing last line <code>deep: 7892</code>.
Now it aborts on some assertion giving this great message:</p>

<p>Folks from <a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&amp;channel=%23rust">#rust on irc.mozilla.org</a>
said that theoretically this code must print something like
<code>task '&lt;main&gt;' has overflowed its stack</code>, but overflow probably occurs in
println statement, so we have this nice Lovecraft quote instead.</p>
